                        The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.<br>
                        Outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gather, often in crowded indoor settings and where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.<br>
                        To make your environment as safe as possible:    
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.</li>
                        <li>Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.</li>
                        <li>If you can’t avoid crowded or indoor settings, take these precautions:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open a window to increase the amount of natural ventilation when indoors.</li>
                            <li>Wear a mask (see above for more details).</li>

                    <p>If you feel unwell, here’s what to do.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first and follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
